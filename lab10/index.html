      <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p id="challenges">I couldn't complete the Lab in it's entirity. I have a input box and a submit button but it doesn't return anything. I'm confused on what's supposed to happen.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p id="problems">I was not able to complete Task 2 of this Lab. I'm having a hard time understanding the types of functions like sort or anagram. I don't know how to implement them in my JavaScript file.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p id="results">Working website with CSS but that's about it. I made an appointment with Wes to get further clarification on this.</p>
