        <p>I honestly was really lost when I first looked at the tasks for this lab but with the help of Wes I was able to properly include jQuery elements and create 3 working buttons that changed the div color for my website. My understanding of JavaScript and jQuery was much more clear after this meeting.</p>

        <p>I didn't know what the buttons were supposed to do or how to add the jQuery Event Listener. However I was able to get a working site uploaded with the help of Wes and my understanding of these topics is way clearer.</p>
