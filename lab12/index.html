      <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I believe I completed all tasks but for some reason my link to my JavaScript won't work in my HTML, so JavaScript functions like the sortingHat did not retrieve any house when submitting your name.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I will check with my section on why my JavaScript was not linking.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>I have CSS elements and a working site with the feature where a user can enter their name in the sorting hat, but it never gave back the house to the user. This was because my JavaScript would not link properly..</p>
