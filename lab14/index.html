        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I had challenges with Lab 12 as I could not get the Sorting Hat function to work.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I had problems with using the proper name of the element to get the function to work. I double checked this and made sure my button worked and the function was able to return the value of the name of the house the user was sorted into.</p>
      </div>
      <div id ="results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>I was able to fix any bugs by checking the console and now have a working sorting hat function.</p>

    <h2>Debugging</h2>
    <p>Here is a screenshot of my debugged code and a screenshot of my working website with the sorting hat function.</p>

    <p>A screenshot of my working website with the debugged function. I fixed this old lab by double checking that I had used the correct element names and double checking with the console to see what was wrong. After fiddling around with the code it seemed to be on its way to working and the console told me the only thing that was wrong was that I placed an unnecessary period on line 8 of my JavaScript file, which was causing the function not to work. After fixing this the sorting hat returned the user with the house they were sorted into.</p>
