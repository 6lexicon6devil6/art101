		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	<div>
		<h3>Subject of this lab</h3>
			<p>The subject of this lab was to have a proper understanding of the structure of folders, files, and images, while practicing programming skills needed for HTML.</p>
		<h3>Difficulties I encountered</h3>
			<p>The only difficulty I encountered was trying to fit the selfie I chose into the home page. It was a lot bigger but then I decided to crop it, which didn't really solve the problem of taking up so much space but this is something I can fix later in CSS.</p>
		<h3>Results of my work</h3>
			<p>I was able to create a working index.html which you are looking at right now. Below are captioned screenshots of my process.</p>
