		<h3>Challenge</h3>

			<p>Despite running into minor problems in Task 1, I completed Tasks 1-4 succesfully.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>

			<p>For Task 1, I did get a little stuck when I had to declare myMainRide as an object. However, when I re examined my previous attempts I was able to correct my mistakes and successfully complete Task 1 entirely.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>

			<p>You are looking at the index.html file I created. I was able to succesfully complete a JavaScript activity that includes Arrays and Obejects.</p>
