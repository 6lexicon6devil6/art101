		<h3>Challenge</h3>

			<p>Although I tried to complete a working publish site, It didn't really work, I'm not sure what's supposed to happen in my browser. I'm still having a hard time understanding Javascript functions. I want to attend section and clarify about this.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>

			<p>I'm unsure of what's supposed to be on my browser. I think I just need to work on understanding arrays better.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>

			<p>I used JavaScript to create a function, but it didn't work. I want to discuss this in section.</p>
