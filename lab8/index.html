      <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>I had to experiment a bit to get everything in my javascript file to work. I'm having a hard time understanding functions still but I'm hoping that as class progresses it will become easier for me.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I was able to complete every task efficiently.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Go to the console to see the output!</p>
