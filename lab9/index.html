      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p id="challenges">I had to ask for help from the group I'm in for the final project. Although I was able to understand how to do these tasks better I still could not get the "appendChild" part to work. I've included a screenshot of the error that pops up when I go to the console.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p id="problems">I was not able to get "appendChild" to work. I want to discuss this in my section tomorrow.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p id="results">Console says "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property "appendChild" of null at lab.js:11".</p>
